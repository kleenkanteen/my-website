# What's poppin

If you notice my Linkedin, you'll notice Keepsake shut down mid-feb. I didn't make that decision until 2 months after, when I realized I had not worked on it in 2 months.

# The first startup

In mid-feb actually, I joined a pre-revenue startup in the home contractor space. It's software heavy because a HVAC company might have 10 technicians and pull in mad cash. They need a lot of paperwork and coordination to run smoothly. [ServiceTitan](servicetitan.com) is the market leader, charging $269/technician/mo, and their feature set is HUGE. Invoicing, dispatching, contract management, customer communication, etc. The idea was to go head to head against them and the other players in the space. 

The founder was director of operations for his dad's company in new york for 4 years, and wanted to build a better solution. Hard working and responsive guy. Good talker. But long story short, he was building before validating. Had his father's company, who wasn't the ICP according to him, lined up for the pilot. Why is the pilot being done on a non-ICP customer? His had wasn't excited for it either, they were using some 20 year old software that looked ugly, but did the job.

He had a discord community of 20 business owners in the space, but didn't call with every single one of them to see if they would switch to a totally new platform.

Long story short, I told him to start cold emailing and calling, and he did a bit, but didn't put in that much time. Most of his time was managing the linear. So I left. The MVP was 75%ish done, he had relied on a brazillian guy, Jason, who had a dev agency and brought in 2 devs of his own. Jason was a very interesting fella, he was 22 and was a lightning bolt programmer. I could write a whole article about him. He could write complex code quick. He was getting $2500/mo for him and his team.

I had brought in 4 devs I knew also with me to help out, who were crucial and did good work. All part time, all competent. 3 were from Keepsake, and 1 who was gonna join Keepsake, but it didn't pan out but I kept in touch. I messaged them and pulled them out when I realized this idea has no solid market potential. ServiceTitan raised $1.1 billion and has a huge product. A bootstrapped company can't compete with that. They're not even that expensive to start off with, I only found out the price on reddit.

Nonetheless, there is tons of mony in the home contractor space. probook.ai grew from 0 to $2m ARR in just 6 months (founder's linkedin post). They do automated dispatching, and integrate with ServiceTitan.

# The second startup

Now fast forward to mid march, I left. I see a nontechnical founder on reddit posting that they are not happy with their current technical cofounder, and that communicating with them is like pulling teeth. And a feature hasn't been shipped in 6 months So I messaged him saying that his cofounder is probably on the verge of leaving, because at Keepsake, when teammates put in significantly less hours suddenly, they left within 1-2 weeks later. Sample size of 3.

That wasn't the case for the guy I talked to though, seems like his cofounder was coasting at 10h/week for a year or 2. The startup was making 85k arr, going on for 5.5 years, and breaking even. The idea was a documentation request platform for HR departments. This way, if a new employee is hired and HR needs 5 forms from them, this app can be used to send them the forms, allow them to sign it, and HR can know which ones they submitted and approve it, or resend if rejected. 

I left ultimately because it was a red ocean, just like the first startup above. Competitors had richer feature sets, while being cheaper ($3000 vs. $5500 according to one comparison). One common argument the founder told me was that they would often lose potential customers, because they didn't support the features they needed, such as role based access control. Well that $3000 competitor has all those features, while being cheaper.

When I joined I did't read too much into the competitors. Wish I did. I though sales could compensate, and the founder showed me the sales kanban board, and it looked pretty full. But the month I was there, he hadn't managed to get 1 sale. He did have meeting(s) with 2 leads, one school HR person, and another real estate lending firm. But no deal came out of it the time I was there.

He also had poor sales data and no real sales strategy. He didn't record all his meetings. Any founder who doesn't record their meetings is making a rookie mistake. You will not remember several important details during an hour call. I've had this happen to me at Keepsake before, I would rewatch the meeting, and then remember important details I forgot.

After every 50 or so sales calls, you should review all your sales recordings/feedback, and then update your sales strategy. This can range from the questions you ask throughout the demo to learn about your customer, to the sequence of features you use. Always make sure your documentation is not missing anything. 

And when I challenged him once on why a feature was necessary, he said "I don't need to convince you on why we are building features". In these moments I found out he was an impatient, uncollaborative guy.

He should have shut down the startup when he wasn't making a profit a year later. Good startups grow fast, $0-$2m ARR in 6mo for example. Just yesterday I talked to one YC founder, and they grew from $50k-$600k ARR in 5 weeks back in jan. All hugely profitable. These are top 10% of startups ofc, but you see the rate of growth. Good startups don't stay unprofitable for 5.5 years.

# Now

After, leaving that, it was mid-apr. 2 months from then to now. 

I won't lie, it's been a blur and a very unproductive time compared to the past 2 years. Was sleeping at 6am for most of it. My sleep schedule degenerates when I don't have something I'm excited or focused about. I'm living off of vibes, when at first I was very uneasy about. I wanted to do something interesting.

But I'm now comfortable on living through vibes. I'm doing what interests me and I'm happy. 

I did a few hours of job searching, but the job search grind is way too soulless and boring. I already did plenty, starting from even before graduating, and from 1200 applications only got 4 technical interviews. Couple more recruiter screens that didn't work out. This job market is screwed, and hiring managers have 0 skill in identifying talent. So I am not job searching anymore.

I will give myself the next 3 months, until the end of august, to find a startup idea to pursue. My goal is to find an idea I can get $100k ARR worth of LOIs signed. I'm much better equipped now, because I learned a lot about sales from Keepsake, and from other founders I talked to. I have tons 
of startup ideas, it's now just a matter of validating them.

I recruited 2 of my friends who were with from Keepsake to help out. They and I were the team right when we shut down. We've been brainstorming here and there since, and they are free full-time along with me.

My plan is that each of us will own an idea and validate it through the proper outbound channel.

I'm exploring the GIS space (geography and mapping tech). I'm solely using Linkedin for outbound and it's been great, amazing actually compared to cold calling and emailing (in legal). Best response rate I ever got at 10% of connection requests netting a response.

I've sent 250 connection requests so far on Linkedin, and got 20 answers toa list of 7 questions I send. These range from people with different job titles, from GIS analyst to GIS director. 

I also netted 2 calls with 2 directors, one being 30min, the other an hour.

I had a call a month ago with one GIS director of a medium sized consulting firm. Friendly and open guy, it was a 1h long call, not too valuable, but he gave me some tips on how to use workplace politics to your advantage. This guy was a master at that.

4 days ago, I had a 35min call with the public works & water utilities director of a city of 20k: Evans, CO. Talked to him while he was driving to work conveniently. One of the most interesting conversations in my life. He had a pain point regarding the software they used to send out field teams to repair water pipes. 

They were a lower income city, so their budget was limited, and they used Brightly. But they had issues and if I remember right, they stopped using it. When I asked him what software his department uses to run their field operations, he started with "this is a sore point". The first thing he remembered was pain. He said he wished there was an asset management software that integrated better with their ticketing system.

Another quote: "... how we build that information in is a huge challenge. Our goal would be to have something a little more built out, and a little more field friendly. When our water team is out there, they could have a tablet and GPS beacon. Vs. Some cities have a whole team that trails these teams and updates their systems". 

"If we can find a company that does an all-in-one solution, we're not the only utility using off the shelf platform for utility billing and customer service. We haven't been able to find one of those off the shelf tools, without a little bit of customization".

"We had a half-baked solution to begin with, and with the 3rd system, we're forced to be creative, changing that platform yet again".

He said the current solutions out there price based on population, but a low income population like his will bring in less money than a high income one. Keep in mind that he manages a budget of $19m. A lower budget for a city of this size probably means instead of being to afford a solution that costs $100k/year, they can only afford $50k/year. This is big bucks in general. 

At the end I said I'm into startups and if enough people have the same problem, I might build the solution. He said "I would greatly appreciate that, especially if it's budget friendly, which is what we struggle with. All the smaller companies are getting bought out by the bigger one and jacking up the prices."

I called him using google voice (easier to talk on vs my phone), and recorded it. Glad I recorded it because there was so much value in that call. I will review it later to help guide my future questions to other directors. I learned about problems I never knew existed.

I found him by luck. I was looking for power utility company directors earlier the day earlier. Somehow he came across and I sent him a connect req, not knowing he worked for a city. And now I learned about a whole new class of customers: city utility departments.

This call gave me the idea that I should talk to other directors like him. They may have similar problems. I opened up Linkedin search and typed "public works director", and I got page after page of results. Neat.

The next day (Friday), I sent 20 of connection requests and of those, 2 replied 36 hours later saying they are happy to answer my questions. I booked a call with one for Wed 10am, he is the director of Glendale, CA. Huge city with a middle class population at 180k. I am betting that the budget will be higher and challenges much different than the first guy I talked to.

If I can talk to 50-100 of such directors, I think I can find out where the gap in the market here. I see the spark of opportunity. And it's fun talking to different people, learning new things, and formulating my questions. Problem discovery is fun. A billion times more fun than job searching...
