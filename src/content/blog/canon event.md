Every startup has canon events. If you watched Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse before, you know what I mean.

If you don't, a canon event is an experience in a person's life that comes to shape who they are. 

This moment is happening very soon for my startup, I'm expecting at the end of this week. A COO I met gave me a chance. He is interested. 

My inner historian wants to record this moment before the jump.

The past 3 months of grinding on this startup has led to this moment: all the outreach, the tens of calls, traveling to 3 energy conferences and cold approaching directors. Finding a transmission engineer after 100-200 of LI requests and responding to each response. Almost 100% of my time and effort spent on this pursuit. I spent 16h yesterday working on the demo prototype.

It's all leading to this, I can feel the suspense. 

And I will deliver.
