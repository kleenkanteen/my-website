# What Happened

On Dec 11, 2022, I woke up dizzy and with blurry vision. I remember walking down the stairs like a drunk, in zigzag, but I thought it was normal since I woke up. But that never happened before. I managed to make it down the stairs slowly but surely. My mom saw me doing this and said I looked like a skeleton and something was wrong with how I was walking. I brushed if off.

After feeling worse myself over the next 30 minutes, my parents called the ambulance and I was put on the stretcher and arrived at the ER. Got a spot quickly. Got some insulin
and fluids and 5 hours later, transferred to the ICU for 2 days. Then was in the normal ward for a day before I got released. I was diagnosed with DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis). 

For the past month I was peeing 1.5 hours after drinking anything more than half a cup of water. I had unknowingly lost about 20% of my body weight. I got cramps in my thighs and wrists 
for some reason. My blood sugar was 66mmol. The average person has about 5mmol in their blood. I had 13x the average amount of sugar in my blood. Turns out over the past few months, my immune system had killed off most of my insulin cells. I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. A different disease than type 2 diabetes, the popular kind, which is when your cells become resistant to insulin usually due to weight and diet. My grandma and uncle had type 1. Go figure. Easy disease to manage though. The easiest chronic disease I would say. But when not managed right with healthy eating and correct insulin dosing, it has one of the worst effects a human can get. Losing eyesight, needing a kidney or pancreas replacement. Healing ability impaired. Heart disease, stroke. But if you keep your blood sugar average at a nondiabetic level, you have no risk. As if you are a nondiabetic. This has been me for the past 1.5 years. My blood sugar average is a bit better than the average nondiabetic actually, at a 5.0. My mom was at a 5.2 once and my dad at 5.7. I'm doing great and it's on average 10 minutes of management of day. Have to poke a small 4mm needle to inject insulin in my stomach everytime I eat, but it's usually painless and is 5 seconds of pain at most. Forgettable.

Back to the ER visit. When I got out, I spent 20-40 hours reading research article after article to know everything around this disease. It was very interesting. If you are a guy with type 1 diabetes, your children have a 6% chance of getting it. My grandma and mom's brother got it as adults, 25 and 32 respectively. I got it at 21. 

A few months after getting out, I requested my medical records out of curiosity. When I compared what treatment I got with what treatment guides from doctors and scientists who actually did the work to figure out what to administer and how much, I was surprised. My ER doctor, who also specialized in endocrine diseases such as diabetes, made embarrassing mistakes that could have killed me. A nurse may have saved my life. The bastard gave me 6x more insulin than he should have without any potassium (which care guides always say to give upon presentation). Too much insulin too fast can cause brain swelling and kill me, aka cerebral edema. It's actually the biggest killer of treatment of high blood sugar. And that amount of insulin also caused my potassium to drop severely low and my heart started to hurt soon after. I told the nurse my chest hurts. Soon after, a critically low reading came back of potassium. The guy gives me potassium, but doesn't stop the insulin. Really dude? A older nurse, not mines but the room next door, saw me soon after and suggested to the doctor to turn it off. She was concerned when she saw me, she told my nurse "he's so young". I remember her walking up to me and turning it off by twisting the plastic valve on the wire. I whispered "don't I need it?", through my dry throat that could barely speak due to extreme dehydration. She said "yes, but wait". Soon after, heart pain went away. Who knows what could have happened if she was not there?

I wrote a full explanation on the doctor's mistakes, 3 of which could have killed me. [Link](https://share.note.sx/6mh8l66d#ZY0srxBT+Y+p0lWoGM6es0rvViSrjDEArTA2eFSaFbI). His name is Fady Alla Hannah-Shmouni. This was at the Mississauga Hospital in Ontario, Canada. Here is his [Twitter](https://x.com/drshmouni?lang=en). 

This was the start of my interactions and studying that showed me most doctors know very little about medicine. They don't read research articles and give misleading, even dangerous advice. I write about how endocrinologists give dangerous advice about your blood sugar in the intro in my [guide on how to manage type 1](https://rentry.co/managetype1). Only a few doctors, such as Dr.Bernstein, actually keeps up to date with the research and give medically sound advice. He in his 80s and actually type 1 himself and became a endocrinologist in his 40s because he suffered from the horrible side effects of keeping the high blood sugar that endocrinologists recommended to him. He found a way to keep his blood sugar at nondiabetic levels and reversed many of his complications. He is probably the single person on this earth who knows the most about type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Yet his advice is not followed by most endocrinologists. Medical education is outdated like most education (in my experience). The education system is taught by people who don't know or care about what they are teaching. They are just there to get a paycheck.

Next time you go to a doctor, always research about your condition before you go, and about whatever they tell you. Don't trust them. Most are clueless in my experience. My mom's doctor dismissed her concern of peeing as "getting old". She actually had a UTI that turned to a kidney infection that gave her severe pain. She could have died. And so could I.
