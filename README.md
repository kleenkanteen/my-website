# Welcome to my website!

Make yourself cozy in my temple on the internet! Feel free to take a look at my work and articles 😃.

Made with AstroPaper, made with 🤍 by [Sat Naing](https://satnaing.dev) 👨🏻‍💻 and [contributors](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper/graphs/contributors).

I found the template from [https://astro.build/themes/](https://astro.build/themes/) mid 2023. Loved the design and simplicity. Finally on the quiet night of March 2, 2023, I breathed life into it while listening to [piano ghibli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhdX3Wcxwas). I hope you like it. 😊
